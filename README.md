# Predictive Healthcare Analytics

## Overview

The Predictive Healthcare Analytics system is designed to reduce patient no-shows in small and medium-sized healthcare clinics using machine learning. By leveraging a Random Forest classifier, this solution predicts the likelihood of patient no-shows, enabling healthcare providers to optimize scheduling, improve resource utilization, and enhance patient care.

## Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: Accurately predict patient no-shows using a machine learning model.
- **Dashboard**: Intuitive interface displaying key metrics, patient appointment lists, and real-time alerts for high-risk appointments.
- **Appointment Management**: Interactive calendar view, patient profiles, and rescheduling/reminder functionalities.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Generate performance reports and gain insights into predictive model decisions.
- **Integration with EHR**: Seamless integration with existing Electronic Health Record systems.
- **Security and Compliance**: Ensures data security and compliance with healthcare regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
